# Dark_matter_paper_I_read

Inspired by Hang Yu, I created a list of papers I read (dark matter research related) here as a reminder to myself. Hope this would be helpful if you are interested in dark matter as well.



## Power Spectrum with Strong Lensing
[Quantifying the power spectrum of small-scale structure in semi-analytic galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03501)


[Probing the small-scale structure in strongly lensed systems via transdimensional inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06111)

[Beyond subhalos: Probing the collective effect of the Universe's small-scale structure with gravitational lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07897)

[Measuring the power spectrum of dark matter substructure using strong gravitational lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2720)
